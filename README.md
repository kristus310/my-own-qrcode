# GoCypher
## ! IN PROGRESS !
### GoCypher is mine own version of QRCode made from scratch.
 - For learning purposes and fun!
 - All of the code is written in Go with Fyne GUI library
 - The name, *GoCypher* is made up from:
    - *Go* - It was written in Golang
    - *Cypher* - Because I am "cyphering" the users URL/data
    - but also it is a pun to Golangs mascot, *Gopher* :D
